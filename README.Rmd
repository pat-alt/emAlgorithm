# Latent variable models 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A brief exploration of a simple multilevel regression model as in Gelman, Hill (2007). We will use the EM algorithm the uncover the latent factors and fit the multilevel regression model. To do so we first need to derive the *expected* complete data log-likelihood (CLL):

$$
Q(\theta, \theta_{t-1}) = \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X}, \theta_{t-1})} \left[ \log \ell (\theta | \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{z}) \right]
$$

All details can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
